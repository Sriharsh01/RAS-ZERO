# RAS-ZERO
Creating the Flipper Zero Model using Raspberry PI
The Flipper Zero is a versatile tool for RF communication, NFC, infrared (IR) control, GPIO hacking
Required Hardware
To match Flipper Zero’s capabilities, you’ll need:

RF Module (Sub-GHz, 433MHz, etc.) – CC1101 module for sub-GHz radio communications.
NFC Module – PN532 or RC522 module for NFC and RFID reading/writing.
IR Transceiver – IR LED and IR receiver for remote control cloning.
GPIO Expansion – To control other devices like garage doors and relays.
SD Card (32GB or more) – For storing logs, payloads, and firmware.
External Power Source – A battery pack or USB power bank for portability.
Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Dongle (if needed) – For wireless attacks and penetration testing.
